## ⚠️ Important Note on API Key Restriction

This project uses **Google APIs** for translation and text-to-speech features, which require a **private API key** for authentication.

For **security reasons**, the API key is **not included** in the project files and **prevents public upload or sharing** of the complete working application.

If you wish to run the project locally:

1. **Obtain your own Google API key** from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).  
2. **Replace the placeholder** in the configuration file or code with your generated key.  
3. **Verify your key permissions and billing settings** are correctly configured.

> 🔐 **Note:** Sharing or uploading the API key publicly violates Google’s Terms of Service and can expose your account to unauthorized access and billing misuse.
